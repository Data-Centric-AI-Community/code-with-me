# Our *Epic* Code With Me sessions

**Looking for a space to jam with other data enthusiasts? Then we'll be happy to welcome you into our code-with-me sessions! üí™**


At the Data-Centric AI Community, we get together every other Thursday to discuss the latest trends in data science and machine learning. In each session we try out something new and build a small project together!

**How does it work? It's super simple!**

 - Join us on [Discord](https://tiny.ydata.ai/dcai-community-github) and check the Calendar for our next session!
 - Prepare your computer to follow along the tutorial
 - When the time comes, join the voice channel üß†*-code-with-me*
 - Ask as many questions as you want, by chat or voice, and enjoy!

If you have a cool idea for a new code-with-me session or you'd like to host one, you call leave us a comment here on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Data-Centric-AI-Community/code-with-me/discussions) or on [Reddit DataScienceCoders](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceCoders/).


## Previous Sessions

### Getting Started with the Open Source FiftyOne Computer Vision Toolset üëÅÔ∏è
- **What did we do?:** In this session explored how to use the [FiftyOne toolset](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone) to achieve high-quality computer vision datasets and models. We went through the basics of exploring the FiftyOne app, from loading the data to generating and evaluating models.
